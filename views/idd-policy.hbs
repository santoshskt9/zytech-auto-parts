    <section id="overview">
      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>This International Delivery & Duties (IDD) Policy explains our practices for international shipping, customs clearance, import duties, taxes and related customer responsibilities when ordering goods from Zytech Auto Parts (the "Company", "we", "us" or "our"). It applies to all orders shipped from the UK to destinations outside the United Kingdom unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
      <p>Please read this policy carefully before placing an international order. By placing an order, you accept these terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="shipping-destinations">
      <h2>2. Shipping Destinations & Availability</h2>
      <p>We ship to most countries worldwide. However, certain parts, hazardous items, or restricted products may not be permitted for export or import to some destinations. If your chosen product cannot be shipped to your country, we will inform you during checkout or contact you after order placement.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="shipping-costs">
      <h2>3. Shipping Costs & Charges</h2>
      <p>Shipping costs for international orders depend on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Destination country</li>
        <li>Parcel size and weight</li>
        <li>Chosen courier and service level (standard, express)</li>
        <li>Any required export documentation or special handling</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Shipping charges are calculated at checkout. For large or heavy auto parts we may contact you with a bespoke shipping quote before dispatch.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="customs-duties">
      <h2>4. Customs, Import Duties & Taxes</h2>
      <p><strong>Import duties, taxes, VAT and customs clearance fees</strong> are the responsibility of the recipient/customer and are not included in the product price or the shipping charge unless explicitly stated at checkout. These fees are assessed by the customs authority of the destination country and may vary by product type, value, and local regulations.</p>

      <div class="notice">
        <strong>Important:</strong> We cannot estimate or accept responsibility for import duties, taxes or customs delays. Please contact your local customs office for details on applicable charges in your country prior to placing an order.
      </div>

      <p>Possible charges you may encounter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Import duty and customs taxes set by the destination country</li>
        <li>Local VAT or GST charged on imports</li>
        <li>Customs brokerage or handling fees charged by the courier</li>
        <li>Storage fees for prolonged customs clearance</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="who-pays">
      <h2>5. Incoterms & Who Pays Customs</h2>
      <p>Unless otherwise agreed, our online sales are generally dispatched <strong>Delivered At Place (DAP)</strong> — the buyer is responsible for import customs clearance, duties, taxes and any associated fees. In some cases we may offer Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) for specific countries or orders; if so, DDP terms and costs will be presented at checkout.</p>
      <p>If you select a courier service that requires the recipient to pay duties on delivery, the courier may request payment before releasing the goods.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="customs-process">
      <h2>6. Customs Clearance & Documentation</h2>
      <p>To clear customs, shipments typically require accurate commercial invoices and descriptions of contents. We will attach standard documentation for customs but cannot guarantee specific classification or tariff codes used by destination authorities.</p>
      <p>If customs authorities request additional documentation (e.g., proof of origin, import licences, certifications), you may be required to provide these or supply consent for us to obtain them. Additional processing time and fees may apply.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="delays">
      <h2>7. Delivery Timeframes & Delays</h2>
      <p>International delivery times are estimates only. Typical transit times depend on the courier and service level and may be affected by customs processing, local holidays, pandemics, or other unexpected delays.</p>
      <p>We are not liable for delays caused by customs processing or actions of third-party carriers. We will provide tracking information where available so you can monitor progress and estimated delivery dates.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="returns-international">
      <h2>8. Returns, Exchanges & International Refunds</h2>
      <p>Returns for international orders must comply with our standard Returns Policy. However:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customers are responsible for return shipping costs, customs clearance and export/import duties on returned items unless the return is due to our error (faulty or incorrect item).</li>
        <li>We recommend using a tracked service and retaining proof of shipment; we are not responsible for items lost in return transit unless we arranged the return shipment.</li>
        <li>Customs duties and taxes paid on import are typically not refundable by the destination customs authority. If applicable, we will refund the product price (subject to our returns policy) but cannot guarantee reimbursement of duties or taxes — you will need to reclaim these from your local customs authority according to their procedures.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="restricted-items">
      <h2>9. Restricted, Prohibited & Hazardous Items</h2>
      <p>Certain automotive parts may be classified as restricted or hazardous for international transport (e.g., batteries, airbag components, certain fluids). We will comply with export control and transport regulations and may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refuse to ship restricted/hazardous items to certain destinations</li>
        <li>Require special packaging, documentation, or courier services</li>
        <li>Charge additional handling or compliance fees</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If a product cannot be exported to your country, we will notify you and cancel or amend the order and issue a refund for the item (excluding duties or taxes you may have already paid locally).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="buyer-responsibilities">
      <h2>10. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>By placing an international order you agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate shipping and contact details</li>
        <li>Be responsible for payment of any import duties, taxes, and fees charged by your country</li>
        <li>Provide any additional documentation that may be reasonably requested for customs clearance</li>
        <li>Comply with applicable local laws regarding importation of automotive parts</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="tracking-and-claims">
      <h2>11. Tracking, Lost Shipments & Claims</h2>
      <p>We will provide tracking information for dispatched shipments when available. If a shipment is marked as delivered by the carrier but you have not received it, please:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Check with neighbours and any secure delivery locations</li>
        <li>Contact the carrier with the tracking number</li>
        <li>Inform us within 7 days so we can open an investigation with the carrier</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Claims for lost or damaged goods are subject to carrier terms and may require photographic evidence, proof of value and packaging. We will assist with claims but are subject to the carrier’s liability limits.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="tax-vat">
      <h2>12. VAT, GST & Local Tax Considerations</h2>
      <p>Depending on the destination, local VAT, GST or sales tax may be charged at import. These taxes are typically collected by the carrier or customs authority on import. We do not control local tax rates.</p>
      <p>For business customers, local tax regulations may allow recovery of import VAT through local VAT reclaim processes — please consult your local tax advisor for guidance.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="insurance">
      <h2>13. Insurance</h2>
      <p>Shipments may be covered by carrier insurance or optional additional insurance. If you require additional insurance beyond our standard coverage, please contact us prior to dispatch to arrange and agree the cost.</p>
