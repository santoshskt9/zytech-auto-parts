  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to Zytech Auto Parts. These Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms") govern
    your purchase of goods from Zytech Auto Parts ("we", "our", "us"). By
    ordering parts from our website, by phone, or by email, you agree to be
    bound by these Terms. If you do not accept these Terms, please do not place
    an order.</p>
</section>

<section id="definitions">
  <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Buyer / Customer:</strong>
      the person, company or organisation that purchases goods from Zytech Auto
      Parts.</li>
    <li><strong>Goods / Parts:</strong>
      any new or used automotive parts supplied by Zytech Auto Parts.</li>
    <li><strong>Contract:</strong>
      the agreement formed between Zytech Auto Parts and the Customer for the
      sale of Goods.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="ordering">
  <h2>3. Ordering &amp; Acceptance</h2>
  <p>All orders are subject to acceptance by Zytech Auto Parts. We may accept or
    decline an order at our discretion. When you place an order, you will
    receive an order acknowledgement. A binding contract will be formed only
    when we dispatch the Goods or otherwise expressly confirm acceptance in
    writing.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to refuse orders from customers with outstanding
    balances, incorrect information, or where we suspect fraud.</p>
</section>

<section id="pricing">
  <h2>4. Pricing &amp; Payment</h2>
  <p><strong>4.1 Prices:</strong>
    Prices shown on our website or provided in quotes are in GBP and exclude
    applicable VAT (unless stated otherwise) and delivery charges. We make
    reasonable efforts to ensure prices are accurate; however, we reserve the
    right to correct pricing errors.</p>
  <p><strong>4.2 Payment:</strong>
    Payment must be received in full before dispatch unless you have agreed
    credit terms with us in writing. We accept payment by the methods displayed
    at checkout (card, bank transfer, or other methods specified).</p>
  <p><strong>4.3 Title &amp; Ownership:</strong>
    Ownership of the Goods remains with Zytech Auto Parts until we have received
    full payment of all sums due for those Goods (including VAT, delivery and
    any other charges).</p>
</section>

<section id="delivery">
  <h2>5. Delivery &amp; Risk</h2>
  <p><strong>5.1 Delivery:</strong>
    We will deliver Goods to the delivery address you specify. Delivery times
    are estimates only and may vary due to stock, supplier lead times, or
    courier delays.</p>
  <p><strong>5.2 Risk:</strong>
    Risk in the Goods passes to you when the Goods are dispatched from our
    warehouse (or collected by you). It is your responsibility to ensure the
    delivery address is accessible and correct.</p>
  <p><strong>5.3 Failed Delivery:</strong>
    If delivery fails due to incorrect address or the recipient not being
    available, additional charges may apply for re-delivery or storage.</p>
</section>

<section id="returns">
  <h2>6. Returns, Cancellations &amp; Refunds</h2>
  <p><strong>6.1 Cancellation:</strong>
    You may cancel your order before dispatch. Once Goods are dispatched or
    collected, cancellations are subject to our returns policy.</p>
  <p><strong>6.2 Returns for Non-Faulty Goods:</strong>
    If you wish to return non-faulty Goods, you must contact us within 14 days
    of delivery to request a return authorisation. Returns of non-faulty Goods
    are accepted at our discretion and may be subject to a restocking fee.
    Returned Goods must be unused, in original packaging (where possible), and
    in a resaleable condition.</p>
  <p><strong>6.3 Faulty or Incorrect Goods:</strong>
    If Goods are faulty, damaged in transit, or incorrect, please notify us
    immediately and within 14 days of receipt. We will provide instructions for
    return and, after inspection, offer replacement, repair or refund where
    appropriate.</p>
  <p><strong>6.4 Process:</strong>
    All returns require prior authorisation from Zytech Auto Parts. Please do
    not return Goods without our permission. We recommend returning Goods using
    a tracked courier. You are responsible for safe packaging until the Goods
    reach us.</p>
</section>

<section id="warranty">
  <h2>7. Warranty &amp; Condition of Parts</h2>
  <p><strong>7.1 New Parts:</strong>
    New parts supplied by Zytech Auto Parts are covered by the manufacturer’s
    warranty where applicable. Warranty terms vary by item — we will provide
    warranty details on request.</p>
  <p><strong>7.2 Used Parts:</strong>
    Used parts are supplied in their existing condition and are tested where
    practical. Unless otherwise expressly stated, used parts are sold with a
    limited warranty for a specified short-term period (e.g., 30 days) covering
    manufacturing defects that were present prior to sale. "Sold as seen" may
    apply to some used parts — such items will be clearly identified in product
    descriptions and on invoices.</p>
  <p><strong>7.3 Exclusions:</strong>
    Warranties do not cover damage caused by improper fitment, misuse, neglect,
    accident, modification, secondary damage, or wear and tear. Labour costs,
    fitting, or removal charges are not covered unless explicitly agreed in
    writing.</p>
  <div class="notice">
    <strong>Important:</strong>
    You should have parts fitted by a qualified technician and retain proof of
    professional fitting when making a warranty claim.
  </div>
</section>

<section id="liability">
  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Zytech Auto Parts’ total liability
    arising out of or in connection with any contract, tort (including
    negligence), misrepresentation, or otherwise shall not exceed the price paid
    by you for the specific Goods in question.</p>
  <p>We shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special or
    consequential loss or damage, including loss of profit, loss of business,
    loss of goodwill, or loss of use.</p>
  <p>Nothing in these Terms will limit or exclude liability for death or
    personal injury caused by our negligence, or for fraud or fraudulent
    misrepresentation.</p>
</section>

<section id="intellectual">

  <h2>11. Force Majeure</h2>
  <p>We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performing our
    obligations caused by events beyond our reasonable control (including but
    not limited to acts of God, strikes, pandemic, fire, flood, suppliers’
    failures, transport delays, or import/export restrictions). In such cases,
    performance will be suspended for the duration of the disruption.</p>
</section>

<section id="termination">
  <h2>12. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate supply of Goods and services (and any credit
    terms) if you breach these Terms, become insolvent, or fail to make timely
    payment. Termination does not affect rights or liabilities accrued prior to
    termination.</p>
</section>

<section id="general">
  <h2>13. General Provisions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Amendments:</strong>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. The "Last updated" date at
      the top indicates when the Terms were last amended. Continued use after
      changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</li>

      These Terms do not confer rights on any third party under the Contracts
      (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 unless expressly stated.</li>

      If any provision is held unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms remain

      entire agreement between us relating to their subject matter.</li>
